## Technologies used to build this game are:
* Javascript
* CSS
* HTML

## Major hurdles:
* Styling wasn't working for me for the majority of the first day, because my div wasn't set up correctly
* My html pages weren't linking in my Javascript correctly, but got assistance and we got that code corretcted
* I kept getting an error code in my game.js, but was able to get that resolved
* Adding my Favicon took me longer than I thought it would, I had to move files around and then type the code in differently a couple of times. But it worked eventually and know I know how to add a Favicon!

## Future Enhancements:
* Add a timer so it is a timed trivia game
* Add animations to make the game stand out
* Make it multiplayer so people can play against each other and compare scores
